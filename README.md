We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see

Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Nеver gonna make you cry
Nevеr gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

(Oooh, give you up)
(Oooh, give you up)
(Oooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
(Oooh) Never gonna give, never gonna give
(Give you up)
